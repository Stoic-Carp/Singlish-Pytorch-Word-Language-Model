                                                              i like to put my passengers as ease by pointing out where all the airbags are. ending the safety message with "just in case i crash again"
                                                                                                                                                    if i die, tell them to reconstruct me from sock dna.

                                             did i tell you about the time i was going down on my grandmother? all i could taste was horse semen... so i thought to myself, "this must be how she died!"
                                               my wife asked me why i carry a gun around the house. "to fight the decepticons," i said. she laughed. i laughed. the toaster laughed. i shot the toaster.
