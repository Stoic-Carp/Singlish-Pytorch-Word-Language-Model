not only that
All things he make one
dun have him bo simi made that was made. In him was life
and the life was the bright-bright of men. And the bright-bright shines in evrywhere orh-orh one
and the brack-brack catch no ball.


This tar por came to witness (like go court sompa dun bluff one) for the Bright-bright
that long zhong might belib through him. he was not the big Bright-bright
but was sent to say good-good of that Bright-bright. That was the true Bright-bright which gives bright-bright to long zhong coming into the world.

he was in the world
and the world he make one
and the world mm zai him. he came to His kaki-lang
and His kaki-lang did not resip him. But as many as resip him
to those who belib in His mia: who were born
not of hwee
nor of the will of the fresh
nor of the will of man



and we glaps His glory (not of Man U)
the glory as of the only begotten (means ploduce from bo simi) of the Lao Peh
glace and truth zui zui
"This One I last time say one hor
'he who comes after me is preferred before me
for he was before me.'" And of His full-full one we have all resip
and glace for glace
who is in the bosom of the Lau Peh
he has declared him (like when we declare customs one).

but don't have love
I become macam like brass or cymbals
king-kiang
king-kiang kio. And even if I have the gift of prophecy
and understand all the chim things and my knowledge jin kiang
but don't have love
I am nothing. And even if I give all my things to feed the poor
and give my body to kena burn
but still don't have love
I am still bo-liao.

Love eh sai tan and is kind; love won't jealous one; love is not ya ya papaya
is not hao lian; is not chor lor
won't selfish one
won't angry one
but will happy when got truth; tank all things
believe all things
hope all things
tahan all things.

Love won't fail one
sure fail one; if got tongues
sure stop one; if got knowledge
sure disappear one. Because we know things is zi-puah zi-puah one
But when got perfect come liao hor
all the zi-puah zi-puah kind of things no need already.

When I was geenah that time
I talk macam geenah
I understand things macam geenah
I think also macam geenah; but when I grow up become man already hor
I put all these geenah kind of dai zi away. Now is macam we see ownself in the mirror but blur blur one. I know things is zi-puah zi-puah
but then I shall know like I am also known.

Now must follow faith
hope and love
these three things; but the most kiang of the three is love.


What can see
hear and touch
That one beginning have one
you got hear one
you got see one
which was with the Lau Peh and got appear to us. We say loud loud to you what we got see got hear
We write liao then we jin song


Brudder with him and fellow brudders
then we talk nonsense and do not live out the truth. But if we gai gai in the light
like he in the light
his Kia
Like magiclean


but more tok gong


we siao one leh. Bluff ourselves one. Inside no truth sia. But hor if we say we buay sai liao lagi jia lat
he steady one
If we say we nothing wrong one
we maciam say he si sua anyhow bluff people and his word is not in us sia.


My sayang gin na
I write this one give you so that you won't anyhow do wrong thing. But if you all got anyhow do wrong thing
the Steady One


Test see you know him or not
We know that we confirm know him if we follow what he say. The one say
“I know him
” but never do what he say one is talk rubbish one
and he inside also rubbish one. But if you got obey his word ah
Liddat we know we are in him


Peng you
what I write to you is not a command baru come up one; is actually old old one
gu zha already got hear. This old old command is the message you got hear one. But ah this one also is a new command; its truth in him in you also can see
because the orh orh bo liao and the real light already shine until bright bright.

If got people say they in the light but then want to hamtam the kor kor
di di
jie jie
or mei mei ah
he still in the orh orh hi peng ah. People who love their kor kor
di di
jie jie
and mei mei
where they stay very bright one
inside nothing to make they all bua doh. But anyone who buay song kor kor
di di
jie jie
or mei mei is in the orh orh and gai gai in the darkness. They walk here walk there also simi ma kua bo
because is orh orh mah. Like shoot bird liddat.

All the gina
I write give you is because those things you anyhow do until chapalang one kena forgive because of his name. All the lau peh
I write give you


is because you know him who starting got one.

All the not so lao jiao ah hia ah di
I write give you


is because the evil one buay tong you already. All the gina
I write give you


is because you sio pat the Lau Peh.

All the lau peh
I write give you


is because you know him the starting have one.

All the not so lao jiao ah hia ah di
I write give you


is because you gao lat


you got what he say inside you


the evil one really buay tong you.

Dun anyhow love the world
Prease hor
don't go and love the world or anything in the world hor. If you love the world ah
buay sai love Lau Peh one. Because ah everything in the world—whether is your ba the lust
your bak jiu the lust
or your life the hao lian—is not Lau Peh come one
but from the world. The world and all this nonsense will si kiao kiao
Jin sui


Sayang gin na
Liddat we know confirm dia dio is last minute liao
They from us go out one
but actually they not our kaki. Because ah if they are our kaki
they will stay with us; but the zhao go out means they long zhong is not our kaki. Wah lau.

and you all very kiang
all know the truth. I write to you is not because you blur like sotong dunno simi si real thing
but is because you know and because truth inside don't have nonsense one
Those don't believe the Kia one also don't have the Lau Peh; those steady with the Kia also got the Lau Peh


Then you ah
you make sure starting you hear that one stay inside you hor. If liddat
This one he sompah to us—live long long


This one I write is about those want to make you gai gai halfway kena yi lang one (lost la). But you ah
so you no need anybody teach you
not geng one—just like it got teach you
must stay in him.

Now ah
sayang gin na
continue in him
so that later he come we can steady steady buay paiseh in front of him.

If you know that he tok gong
you know that everyone who do the sui sui things is born of him one. Sui!

Wah you see what kind of love Lau Peh give us
cos it dunno know him lah. Sayang
now we are gin na; and not yet reveal to us what we going to be
but we know that when he is revealed hor
we confirm will be like him
cos we will see him for real


means you never see him and dunno him.

Gin na
don't let people bluff you pls. If you do right things
Because liddat
then he can destroy the things


Why Love Important
You see carefully
this is how you can see gin na and the gin na: If they anyhow do things
sub sub soi
Same also those who don't love their brother
From the starting you already here that we should love one another
anyhow go and people - own brother some more! Why he him leh? Cos do things sibei evil but his brother one is kilat.

Brudder
don't chua tio if the world buay song you. We know that we kena pass from death to life already
cos we love all the brudder. Those who don't love brother one only steady with death. If you buay song your brother
is like maciam
and you know won't wan sui one.

Liddat we know love
cos he steady
die for us. So we also must steady
lay down our lives for our brudders. But if you got good things in this world
and you see your brudder very poor thing
and you shut up your heart from him like one kind bo xim
you tell me where got love in you?

Gin na
we don't just love with words
but our action also must steady. Like that then we know that we is of truth one
our heart inside steady before him. Cos if our heart say we no hope
everything also he know. Sayang
if our heart don't condemn us
Those things that you ask you will receive from him
cos you follow His zheng hu do what he say and do those things that he see already happy one
love one another
like he gave us

and he also steady with you. Liddat we know that he steady in us
