Simi Ma Meaningless
“Simi ma bo meaning
” says the Teacher
“long zhong bo meaning!”

Work so hard for what? I come you go
you come I go
also still the same. Sun rises
sun sets
then chiong go back rise again. The wind here blow there like blow wind blow. Blow round round go circle. Rivers go inside the sea
the sea also lao zui
forever not full one. Then the water go back to the river then come out again to the sea go here go there. Everything also sian until bo wei gong. See so much also buay song. Wear how much also buay gao.

Last time thing also happen again and again. All happen before already la! Under the sun one got nothing new. Sometimes people say
“Eh here got new thing!” But actually is old one; bo meng gia is really new la. Last time what happen also we buay gi
next time people also buay gi what we do.

Cher Gong Wei: Wisdom also Sian
I
the cher
I chiong sua search for understanding
explore by wisdom long zhong things being done below the sky
Everything going on below the sky also I see
and really la


What thing do wrong cannot make correct. What thing yi lang cannot find back.
Then I say to myself
“Li kua la li kua la; I wiser than all my lau peh and their lau peh and their lau peh the lau peh. I more wise
more kiang than any of them.” So I chiong to learn everything from wise to siao and gong like sotong. But then I learn chase all this is like chase wind. Kee siao! Got what to catch!?

Make happy oso no use one
I said in my heart
“Lai
lai
I test you to make got fun or not; so enjoy happy lah”; but sure lah
this also no use one. I said of laughter—“Siao ah!”; and of fun
“Got do what one ah?” I look and look in my heart how lim jiu make me happy lah
how my heart be clever one lah
and how to do useless things lah
until can see what good thing people everywhere can do until they die one.

I make all the thing I do very tua liap
I oso got kee chu
and plant lots of grape lah. I plant the garden and plant trees all got fruit one leh. And then I make pond and water the tree to grow big big lah. I oso got servant
girl oso got
boy oso got
and the servant oso got born in my house one. Yar loh
I got a lot a lot of things lah
got many cow and many goat also I got
I oso take lah all the money
silver and gold
the special treasures last time belong to the king and from far far away place I oso got
girl oso got
boy oso got
oso can play all kind of musical instrument one
you know or not.

So I became very tua liap and so grand one
And I still oso very very clever one


My eye got see and I want
I take lorr. My heart want
I take and then I very happy lorr. I work liao so my heart got very happy; And this one ah
my hard work got give me a lot a lot very nice good thing lah. Then I look on all the thing that I do one hah
And on the hard work
wah
so much hard work lah; Really ah
all was no use one like chase the wind only
sien only. Work and work until want to pengsan oso got no profit one lah.

The End of the Clever one and the Stupid one'

Then I see myself and think
got clever or not
got gila or not
got useless or not; The man who come after the king can do what one leh?— Only what other people do oredi. Then I see clever one got better than useless one
like bright bright better than dark dark one. The clever man his head got eyes one
But the stupid man is walking in the dark dark one lah. Ai yo
now I know lah The same thing got happen to everyone lah.

So I kaki kong
“Got happen to stupid people one
Oso got happen to me
And then I got more clever one leh?” Then I said in my heart
“This one hah
oso very useless one lah.” People never got remember the stupid one and oso people never got remember the clever one lah
Everything now they all will forget one lah. The clever man how he got die? Die just like stupid man lah!

And then I hate my life
work until can pengsan oso still very sien one because everything is useless one like chase the wind only mah.

Then I hate all my work
work under the sun until can fainted liao ah
but after that I must give it to that one come after me. he got clever one or very stupid one I oso dono one? But I make one and I work one like so clever under the sun until can fainted one and then he will get oso. This one ah also very useless one. So I turn to my heart until very keksim one ah because work until can die lai dat still can very sien one hor. Because got a man who work got cincia gao gao one ah; he die oredi still must leave all the thing to other people that never work to get that one lah. This one ah oso very useless one and very very bad one hor. The man who work until can pengsan lai dat
and his heart got try so hard one ah under the sun
he got what leh? he still got very sad one lor
work until very sien one ah; at night oso very keksim cannot sleep one. You see lah
all is very useless one.

A man got nothing better but makan and lim jiu
and work oredi he can enjoy lah
Simi lang can makan
can know a lot of things
can enjoy a lot of things
This one ah is oso very useless one like try and catch the wind only you know or not


"Oi
